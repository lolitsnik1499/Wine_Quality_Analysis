In this project, we collect data on different attributes of wine samples, including fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol content, and quality rating.

We start by exploring the dataset statistically, looking at measures like the average (mean), middle value (median), and spread (standard deviation) of each attribute. Then, we investigate how these attributes correlate with the quality rating of the wine. This helps us identify which characteristics are most important in determining wine quality.

Next, we employ machine learning techniques to build predictive models that can estimate wine quality based on its attributes. By training these models on the dataset, we can understand which features are most influential in determining the final quality rating.

Throughout the analysis, we use visualization tools to present the data in a more understandable format, such as scatter plots and barplots to show relationships between different attributes and wine quality.
